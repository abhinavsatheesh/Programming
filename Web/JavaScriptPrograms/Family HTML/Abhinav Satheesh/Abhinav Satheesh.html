<h2 class="center second-colour"> About Me </h2>
<p> I am studying in Bhavans Vidya Mandir Girinagar. I would like to mention my class and standard, but I would rather not, because, it will always change every year. But, I will just write down my class - VII, just so that, if I read these notes years later, I would know when I wrote them.  </p>
<h2 class="center second-colour"> My hobbies </h2>
<p> I like to solve the Rubiks Cube Series, that is , 2X2 Rubiks Cube, 3X3 Rubiks Cube and 4X4 Rubiks Cube or the Rubiks Revenge. I also enjoy playing PS3 in the vacations. I also like to read books, although sometimes I become lazy &#9786;
&#9786;&#9786;. I also like to play Football and Cricket. </p>

<p>I like to eat Aloo Paratha and Paneer Butter Masala. Also, I like to eat Pizza. My favourite Pizza is Country Feast from Pizza Hut.</p>
<h2 class ="center second-colour"> Coding </h2>
<p> I also like Coding. I have created about 6 Android Apps. I also like to code in Python and HTML. I would like to learn how to code in C++,Java Script etc, so that I can understand Windows better</p>
